That was a technical test. I did a git (re)init after removing the company’s color names and logos. They haven't contacted me, so I guess they were not satisfied with it. I have never considered myself a graphic genius; I am someone who opens SVG files in Vim. I’m good at following design specs in CSS, but I can't work effectively without a design plan. Perhaps that was the reason for their lack of interest.

I tried to be innovative and built the project using Next.js since the company is supposed to be working with it. I have a lot of experience with React, but this was my first project using Next.js. It was simple. I’m leaving this note here.
