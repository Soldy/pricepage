That was a technical test. I did a git (re)init after removing the company’s color names and logos. They haven't contacted me, so I guess they were not satisfied with it. I have never considered myself a graphic genius; I am someone who opens SVG files in Vim. I’m good at following design specs in CSS, but I can't work effectively without a design plan. Perhaps that was the reason for their lack of interest.


No doubt, after a couple of days, I see this is one of the worst-looking websites I have ever made. If I count, I was focused on doing something cool; this is absolutely the worst.
However, what I did right is the pattern. I attempted to implement a creational pattern, specifically the singleton pattern. (They probably never care about the design pattern anyway.) 
Most of my ReactJS front end follows the observer pattern, which aligns well with Redux. The Dragonweb is a hardcoded command pattern, and for Vue.js, I prefer the adapter pattern. 
So it's reasonable to leave this here. 
I have always been curious whether Next.js has vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks. Here is the code I can use for testing. It is perfect for my tests.


It should be useful to compare the results of AXP and for future research in NEXT.js.


I tried to be innovative and built the project using Next.js since the company is supposed to be working with it. I have a lot of experience with React, but this was my first project using Next.js. It was simple. I’m leaving this note here.
